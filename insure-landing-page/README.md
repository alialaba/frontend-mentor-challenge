Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development
- CSS grid layout
- Css positioning and pseudo element
- Responsiveness (fluid spacing, layout and fluid font size). 

### Useful resources

- [A Deep Dive Into CSS Grid minmax()](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-minmax/) - This helped me  to achieve a 3 column responsive layout with 3 lines of code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Background position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand to position bg images in x and y axis. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
