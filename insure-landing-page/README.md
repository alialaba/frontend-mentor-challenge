## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Basic-first workflow
- Positioning (relative, absolute)
- Pseudo Elements (::before ::after)

### What I learned
- Strengthen my knowledge on BEM pattern for naming convention.
- Understand the trick of min css property and minmax() with grid Css
- Enhance my css positioning skills and usage of pseudo elements


### Continued development
- CSS grid layout
- Css positioning and pseudo element
- Responsiveness (fluid spacing, layout and fluid font size). 

### Useful resources

- [A Deep Dive Into CSS Grid minmax()](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-minmax/) - This helped me  to achieve a 3 column responsive layout with 3 lines of code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Background position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand to position bg images in x and y axis. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
